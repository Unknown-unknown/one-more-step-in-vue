### Development logs

##### 1. Imported third-party files or resources

- reset.css: used to solve different appearance in different browsers. Also check [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) and compare.
- border.css: used to solve "1px-issue" in mobile webapp.
- fastclick: used to solve 300ms delay in device browsers. `npm install fastclick --save` to install.
- [iconfont](http://www.iconfont.cn/)

##### 2. Some tips
- In `/src/pages/city/components/List.vue`, inside the outest div layer, we wrap all the sub-components in another div, like the content view, embeded in a scrollview.
- In order to visit our website by ip address, we should change lines in `package.json`:

```
    "dev": "webpack-dev-server --host 0.0.0.0 --inline --progress --config build/webpack.dev.conf.js",

```

- When checking out our website with some devices, which are unable to support promise, we'll have to install another package to solve it. `npm install babel-polyfill --save`
- Adding annotations in `<template>` tag seems to be unrecommended, since it will cause unexpected strange behaviors. =ã€‚=
- `npm run build` to pack our website.
- After packing, we have the packed website at `./dist/`. At `./dist/static/js`, we've got three types of js file:
	- `manifest.xxxx.js`: a configuration file generated by webpack;
	- `vendor.xxxx.js`: a shared code using by all the components of all pages;
	- `app.xxxx.js`: logical code of all pages, which can be loaded asynchronously when needed. (more details in `./src/router/index.js` and `./src/pages/home/Home.vue`)

### TODO

- ~~`swiper-pagination` in home and gallary both fail to show. Check version of Swiper maybe...~~ `npm install vue-awesome-swiper@2.6.7 --save` solved it.


### What's next
