# one-more-step-in-vue

### Description

This is self-learning project for Vue.js, which mainly follows [an on-line course of Dell Lee](https://coding.imooc.com/class/203.html) and contains some notes of my own.

There are three parts in this project:
- **Demos:** step-by-step minor points in vue;
- **Pages:** some Q&As (limited by time...);
- **Travel:** a complete project following the course mentioned above.
