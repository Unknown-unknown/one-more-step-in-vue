# One More Step In Vue: Demo Part

### Description

This is self-learning project for Vue.js, which follows an on-line course of Dell Lee [here](https://coding.imooc.com/class/203.html).

It also include some statements, summaries and knowledge suppliment on my own to help understanding.

Welcome to any learn-mate. :P


### Note

- All the sub-folders in this part reference to `vue.js` file at the root.
- There's a `vue-demo.sublime-snippet` file at the root for saving time to create a clean vue demo. ☺️
